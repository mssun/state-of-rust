# State of Rust

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mssun/state-of-rust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mssun/state-of-rust)

State of Rust is a project to automatically summarize various stable/unstable
features of Rust. There is a daily job to check the master branch of Rust
repository and update the state of Rust including:

  - the stable features and their minimal Rust versions
  - features will be stabilized in next few releases
  - unstable features and related issue numbers on GitHub
  - the first commit and the latest commit time

Currently, the information is listed in the following files:

  - stable features: [`stable_feature.txt`](stable_feature.txt)
  - unstable features: [`unstable_feature.txt`](unstable_feature.txt)

You can read related issues of unstable features by issue numbers with this link:
[https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/\[issue number\]](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/)

Our daily [Travis CI jobs](https://travis-ci.com/mssun/state-of-rust) will
update these lists.
