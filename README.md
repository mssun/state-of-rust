# State of Rust

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mssun/state-of-rust.svg?token=LzRfzmiUXDqZVqRYbinm&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mssun/state-of-rust)

State of Rust is a project to automatically summarize various stable/unstable
features of Rust. There is a daily job to check the master branch of Rust
repository and update the state of Rust including:

  - the stable features and their minimal Rust versions
  - features will be stabilized in next few releases
  - unstable features and related issue numbers on GitHub
  - the first commit and the latest commit time

Currently, the information can be obtained from our daily
[Travis CI jobs](https://travis-ci.com/mssun/state-of-rust)
(in `after_success` section, folded sometimes).
